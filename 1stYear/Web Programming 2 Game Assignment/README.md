### Web Programming 2 Cho-Han Game
This is a game assignment from my Web Programming 2 class. 
The game is Cho-Han and it consists of a player that bets money on whether the two die that are rolled are going to add up to odd or even.
If they win they get their money back and more, while if they lose they lose everything they bet.
